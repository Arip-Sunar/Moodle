## 📌 What is Moodle?

Moodle is a free, open-source Learning Management System (LMS) used by schools, colleges, universities, and organizations to create online learning platforms.

## ✅ STEP 1 — Open VS Code

Just open VS Code — no need to open terminal yet.

## ✅ STEP 2 — Open the Command Palette

## Press:

Ctrl + Shift + P


## Type:

Git: Clone


**Click Git: Clone.!**

## ✅ STEP 3 — Enter the Moodle GitHub URL

Paste this in the input box:

**https://github.com/moodle/moodle.git**


Press Enter.

## ✅ STEP 4 — Choose a folder on your computer

VS Code will ask:

“Select Repository Location”

Choose any folder where you want to save the Moodle source code.

Example:

**D:\Projects\moodle**


VS Code will automatically start cloning.

## ✅ STEP 5 — Open the cloned repository

After cloning is complete, VS Code shows:

“Open Repository?”

Choose Open.

Now the full Moodle source code is loaded in VS Code.

You can now read, edit, add plugins, modify UI, etc.
## ✅ To open + edit Moodle source code → VS Code is enough

You only need:

✔ VS Code
✔ PHP extension in VS Code
✔ XAMPP (to run Moodle)

Nothing else.

## 🧩 1) VS Code = Your PHP Editor

VS Code becomes a full PHP editor when you install this extension:

👉 PHP Intelephense

(Search “Intelephense” in VS Code Extensions panel)

This gives you:

1.PHP autocomplete

2.Error detection

3.Go-to-definition

4.IntelliSense

5.Syntax highlighting

So VS Code = PHP Editor.

## 🧩 2) XAMPP = Runs Moodle (very important)

XAMPP gives you:

1.Apache (web server)

2.PHP (runtime)

3.MySQL/MariaDB (database)

**Moodle cannot run without these.**

🔻 So XAMPP is for running Moodle
🔻 VS Code is for editing Moodle

They work together.
